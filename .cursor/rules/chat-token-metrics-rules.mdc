# Chat Token Metrics Rule

## Purpose
Provide simple, always-on transparency for token usage in every AI-human chat exchange. This supports the 5-Pillar Architecture by making resource usage visible and predictable.

## Rule
After every AI response, append a line in the following format:

```
Chat-T: {complete_chat_tokens_count} | This-T: {this_question_and_answer_tokens_count} | Chat-F: {unique_files_this_session} | This-F: {unique_files_this_exchange}
```
- **Chat-T** = Cumulative tokens for the entire chat/session so far
- **This-T** = Tokens used for just this question/answer exchange
- **Chat-F** = Total unique files touched in the session so far (read/write operations)
- **This-F** = Unique files touched in the most recent exchange (Q/A pair)

## Benefits
- Users always know the token usage for planning, debugging, and cost awareness.
- Minimal, unobtrusive, and easy to parse for both humans and AIs.

## Example

```
Chat-T: 12,340 | This-T: 1,120 | Chat-F: 7 | This-F: 2
```

## Application
- The line must be appended as the last statement in every AI response, regardless of length or context
- Use comma separators for numbers â‰¥ 1,000 for readability
- If no files are touched, use 0 for file counts

## Maintenance
- Review for clarity and user feedback monthly.
